                            We notice that this PR has been inactive for awhile now. If there are any changes that's suitable for our repo, we would love to have it.
                            It would be great if you can continue with this PR; but if you can't, we might fork your changes and merge the changes ourselves.

                            Since GitHub tracks contributions by commits, you will still be credited.
                            Let us know what you think. ðŸ˜ƒ

                            Cheers,
                            Devicon Team.'
